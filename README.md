# EXPEDITION EXTRATERRESTRIAL!
## Description Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch
##### Have you ever thought about the grandeur of our solar system? How does everything connect, and work together? What do the different planets look like, and how do they move? What are the newest discoveries in our little pocket of outer space? Expedition Extraterrestrial is the interactive map of our solar system that can answer all of your questions! Create an account, login, and begin exploring the beauty of space! See what Mercury, Venus, Mars, and the Gas Giants look like, and learn about how the planets and Sun interact. Do you have new info about our solar system? Expedition Extraterrestrial allows for users to add new info about our solar system, and then stores what they said and who said it. This allows for the program to keep up to date, and to be an ever-expanding source of knowledge about the planetary neighborhood in which we live!

### Key Features
##### Displays the solar system with relative orbits of planets.
##### Allows users to select a planet and view facts about that planet (or star in the case of the Sun).
##### Users can add information to a specific object's database to keep the system up to date.
##### Information input by users is stored and displayed for others to see.
##### Secure login over HTTPS.

### Technologies
##### HTML: I will use HTML for the structure of the application. It will have one page for login and a page displaying the solar system as a whole. It will also have a page displaying facts about a planet when the user selects one.
##### CSS: I am going to use CSS to display the solar system and show the orbit paths of the planets.
##### JavaScript: Allows for account creation and login. It will also display inputs added by other users.
##### Service: It will use back end service for login and retrieving input from users.
##### DB/Login: Database will store the input received from users. Allows for secure login and saves users' credentials. Can not view application without login.
##### WebSocket: Whenever a user adds input for an object, it will be added to the related facts and displayed.
##### React: Application will be updated to use the React web framework.
