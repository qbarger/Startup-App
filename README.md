## Description Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch
##### Have you ever thought about the grandeur of our solar system? How does everything connect, and work together? What do the different planets look like, and how do they move? What are the newest discoveries in our little pocket of outer space? Expedition Extraterrestrial is the interactive map of our solar system that can answer all of your questions! Create an account, login, and begin exploring the beauty of space! See what Mercury, Venus, Mars, and the Gas Giants look like, and learn about how the planets and Sun interact. Do you have new info about our solar system? Expedition Extraterrestrial allows for users to add new info about our solar system, and then stores what they said and who said it. This allows for the program to keep up to date, and to be an ever-expanding source of knowledge about the planetary neighborhood in which we live!
